# OLinq

The purpose is to provide powerful combinators to express iteration,
transformation and combination of collections of items living in
the type `'a t`. Inspired
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query .

documentation (start with module `OLinq`):

## Notes

This comes from [containers](https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/), where
it was called `CCLinq`. A separate package makes more sense,
as it is fairly specialized, and does not depend on containers anyway.
